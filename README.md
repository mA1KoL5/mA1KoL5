<h1>Hi, I'm Maikol! <h1>
  
Cybersecurity graduate from Florida International University with experience in network security, malware analysis, and system defense. I‚Äôve built projects like a reverse shell detector, port scanner, and file integrity checker using VirusTotal. Passionate about applying my skills to protect systems and analyze threats.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Cybersecurity Projects:</h2>

 <b></b>
  - [Slowloris DoS Simulation](https://github.com/mA1KoL5/slowloris-dos-simulation) 
  -   <b>This project simulates a Slowloris Denial-of-Service attack on a locally hosted Apache server using XAMPP. The goal was to safely understand how low-and-slow attacks work in a closed lab environment.</b>
  - [Port Scanner](https://github.com/mA1KoL5/port-scanner)
  -   <b>This is a simple Python script that scans a target IP address or hostname for the most commonly used TCP ports. It attempts to connect to each port and reports which ones are open.</b>
  - [Reverse Shell Detector](https://github.com/mA1KoL5/reverse-shell-detector)
  -   <b>This project is a Python-based tool designed to detect suspicious outbound connections that may indicate a reverse shell attack. It continuously monitors network activity on a Windows machine, identifying established connections that could signal unauthorized remote access.</b>
  - [VirusTotal File Integrity Checker)](https://github.com/mA1KoL5/virus-checker)
  -    <b>This script scans a directory, calculates SHA-256 hashes for all files, and checks for unexpected changes. New or modified files are looked up using the VirusTotal API to identify potential threats.</b>
